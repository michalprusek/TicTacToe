# Symbol Consistency Fix

## Problem Description

The GUI was displaying symbols that YOLO was not actually detecting in the current frame. This caused inconsistent game state where "phantom symbols" would persist in the GUI even when they were no longer detected by the YOLO models.

### Root Cause

The board state was only being updated additively - symbols were added when detected, but never removed when they stopped being detected. This led to:

1. **Phantom symbols**: Symbols remaining visible in GUI after YOLO stopped detecting them
2. **Inconsistent state**: GUI showing different symbols than what YOLO actually detected
3. **Poor user experience**: Confusing visual feedback that didn't match reality

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive board state synchronization system that ensures the GUI only displays symbols that are currently detected by YOLO with sufficient confidence.

### Key Changes

#### 1. New Synchronization Method (`_synchronize_board_with_detections`)

**Location**: `app/core/game_state.py`

```python
def _synchronize_board_with_detections(
    self,
    detected_symbols: List[Dict],
    class_id_to_player: Dict[int, str]
) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
```

**Functionality**:
- Rebuilds board state from scratch based on current YOLO detections
- Clears board completely when no symbols are detected
- Filters symbols by confidence threshold before placement
- Maps symbols to closest cell centers using distance calculation
- Returns list of changed cells for proper GUI updates

#### 2. Integration with Detection Pipeline

**Location**: `app/core/game_state.py` in `update_from_detection()`

Replaced the old additive symbol placement logic with the new synchronization approach:

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Synchronize board state with current detections
# This ensures GUI only shows symbols that are actually detected by YOLO
changed_cells = self._synchronize_board_with_detections(
    detected_symbols, class_id_to_player
)
```

#### 3. Helper Method for Change Detection

**Location**: `app/core/game_state.py`

```python
def _get_changed_cells(
    self, 
    old_board: List[List[str]], 
    new_board: List[List[str]]
) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
```

Compares board states and returns list of cells that changed, enabling proper GUI updates and animations.

### Behavior Changes

#### Before Fix
- ❌ Symbols persisted in GUI even when YOLO stopped detecting them
- ❌ Board state accumulated symbols without removal
- ❌ Inconsistent visual feedback
- ❌ Phantom symbols confused users

#### After Fix
- ✅ Board state rebuilds from current detections only
- ✅ Empty detections clear the board completely
- ✅ Low confidence symbols are rejected
- ✅ GUI always reflects actual YOLO detections
- ✅ No phantom symbols persist

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_symbol_synchronization.py`:

1. **Empty detections clear board**: Verifies board is cleared when no symbols detected
2. **Low confidence rejection**: Ensures symbols below threshold are not displayed
3. **High confidence placement**: Confirms valid symbols are placed correctly
4. **Board rebuilding**: Tests that board rebuilds from current detections only
5. **Change detection**: Validates helper method for detecting cell changes
6. **Threshold respect**: Confirms custom confidence thresholds are honored

### Configuration

The synchronization respects the existing confidence threshold system:

- **Symbol confidence threshold**: Controlled via `game_state.symbol_confidence_threshold`
- **Default value**: 0.90 (90%)
- **GUI control**: Adjustable via debug window "Symbol Confidence" slider
- **Real-time updates**: Changes take effect immediately

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Synchronization runs once per detection cycle
- **Efficient mapping**: Uses numpy distance calculations for cell mapping
- **Memory efficient**: No additional data structures, reuses existing board state

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing APIs preserved
- ✅ Configuration system unchanged
- ✅ GUI integration seamless
- ✅ No breaking changes to external interfaces

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
pytest tests/test_symbol_synchronization.py -v  # 6/6 passed
pytest tests/test_game_state.py -v              # 14/14 passed
```

## Summary

This fix ensures that the TicTacToe GUI provides consistent, reliable visual feedback that accurately reflects what the YOLO models are actually detecting. Users will no longer see phantom symbols, and the game state will always be synchronized with the current detection results.

The solution is robust, well-tested, and maintains full backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience.
