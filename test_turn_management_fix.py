Test script to verify that the turn management and flag conflict fixes are working correctly.
This test verifies that:
1. Centralized turn management works properly
2. Timer-based scheduling is replaced with immediate execution
3. Turn locks prevent conflicts during arm moves
4. Flag conflicts are resolved
5. Arm consistently takes its turns when it should
