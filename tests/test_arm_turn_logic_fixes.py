"""
Test suite for the robotic arm turn logic fixes.

This module tests the three main fixes:
1. Turn Logic Fix: Arm plays only when odd number of symbols (1,3,5,7,9)
2. Symbol Recognition Fix: Arm plays the symbol that appears less frequently
3. Win Celebration Feature: Arm draws winning line when it wins
